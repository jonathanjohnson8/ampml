#A Machine Learning Application to Decipher Text from Images

Within this repo, I have created a Machine Learning Application to Extract Text from Any Image

Key Use Cases:

Migration from Text-Based Systems to Cloud-Based Systems :

For Healthcare:
There are several health systems that have paper-based patient records. This system could be used to create digital copies of their paper-based records. These digital copies could then be migrated en masse to an Electronic Health Record (EHR) / Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system for quick uploads.
